# EDAV Final Project Fall 2019
**Repo for the Final Project for Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDAV) taught by Prof. Joyce Robbins**


Human mobility is NYC is complex and dynamically changing. In the past couple of years, bike-sharing has taken a major role in the transportation network of big cities as an alternative way of getting around the city. Prior to these times, taxi service was the primary ground transportation. Weather plays a key role in influencing the mode of commute. Several weather variables, including precipitation, sunshine, snow, wind speed and temperature have been shown to influence participation in bicycling.

Bicycling is a widely used form of physical activity. It has been linked to lower risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity and depression. Analyzing the impact of weather on bike ridership and taxi service, would help to understand the NYC commuter physical acitivity. It is also important for the Citi Bike business and for policymakers to be more aware of how individuals behave when they expect certain weather conditions and if this plays a role in individuals finding other forms of transportation that does not rely on being outdoors while commuting. 

This motivated us to further dig deep on this subject and answer the following:

1) What is the general ridership pattern for citibike rides in the New York City area through different months of the year 2018?

2) What is the effect of weather on citibike ridership volume in NYC ?

3) How does weather impact the duration of the rides? Do people only opt for shorter rides during cold/rainy or adverse weather or is the length of the ride not affected?

4) Do we see a relationship between citibike ridership in NYC and NYC taxi ridership? Does weather affect their relationship?
